Data file
	1. contains the situation's text data in raw form
	2. series of lists of phrases or complete thoughs (sentences or phrases connected by conjunctions)
		a. each base phrase (idea) will have list of phrases saying the same thing but with different
			moods. the mood will reflect what the characters relationship status
		b. all pronouns, proper nouns, refs to time, and refs to location will be convered to a key word
			i. each keyword will contain a list of possible replacement words
			ii. each replacement word will be assigned to the phrase based on some criteria.  Things like
				gender, current location, current time, characters speaking, NPC stats
		c. Each replacement word will have some meta data used as a condition for when the word is to be used.
			i. possible structure "pronoun":["he" : ["gender":"male","subject": "true","pov":"third"], 
											 "she" : ["gender":"female","subject":"true","pov","third"],
											 "him" : ["gender": "male","subject": "false", "pov","third"],]
			ii. This will require some mechanism to parse the condition
			iii. each condition will have to be unique
				1. may lead to massive rule lists for each word
				2. probably better to generate more keywords then larger rule sets
				3. "pron1" :["he":"male","she":"female"], "pron2":["him":"male","her":"female"]
		d. Have constant word lists that will be true for every data file module
			i. create a global data file module
			ii. contains keyword lists and conditions for pronouns, constant game locations, time refs, and other constant finite elements
