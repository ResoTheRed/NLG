Data file
	1. contains the situation's text data in raw form
	2. series of lists of phrases or complete thoughs (sentences or phrases connected by conjunctions)
		a. each base phrase (idea) will have list of phrases saying the same thing but with different
			moods. the mood will reflect what the characters relationship status
		b. all pronouns, proper nouns, refs to time, and refs to location will be convered to a key word
			i. each keyword will contain a list of possible replacement words
			ii. each replacement word will be assigned to the phrase based on some criteria.  Things like
				gender, current location, current time, characters speaking, NPC stats
		c. Each replacement word will have some meta data used as a condition for when the word is to be used.
			i. possible structure "pronoun":["he" : ["gender":"male","subject": "true","pov":"third"], 
											 "she" : ["gender":"female","subject":"true","pov","third"],
											 "him" : ["gender": "male","subject": "false", "pov","third"],]
			ii. This will require some mechanism to parse the condition
			iii. each condition will have to be unique
				1. may lead to massive rule lists for each word
				2. probably better to generate more keywords then larger rule sets
				3. "pron1" :["he":"male","she":"female"], "pron2":["him":"male","her":"female"]
		d. Have constant word lists that will be true for every data file module
			i. create a global data file module
			ii. contains keyword lists and conditions for pronouns, constant game locations, time refs, and other constant finite elements

Hub application files:
	1. need to take in information from the game
	2. need to devise a method to combine modules correctly to build complex dialogue
		a. Situation Modules, Dialogue Modules or both
			i. situation modules would involve an action like asking someone out
				1. make larger changes to characters stats
				2. could change relationship status
			ii. dialogue Modules would involve no direct action. Something like discussing a plan
				1. smaller changes to character stats
			iii. Dialogue Modules can lead to Situational Models and vise versa
				1. Small talk can lead to asking someone out or a fist fight
			iv. Ex: Dialogue Module --> small talk --> main topic (unfair work load) --> rabit hole (common interests) --> main topic --> fair well
			v. Ex: Situational Module --> NPCa asks out NPCb and NPCb says no
			vi. Ex: Dialog-Sit-Dialog --> small talk (flirting) --> player asks out NPC  and NPC says yes --> set date plans --> fair well
		b. generate combinations of Modules similar to ensemble's validation rules
			i. Module leads to other modules if the conditions are met (stat based)
	3. Module combinations must follow a protocol
		a. Check for history, relationship statuses, location, time, and anything else
		b. Modules should be able to call other modules direclty as part of their structure
			i. date module can calls greeting, smalltalk, insult or others if needed
	4. Different Modules are reponsible for different things
		a. each module should be labeled as a certain category
			i. Situational --> action (ask on date), changes characters states in a  non-trivial way
				1. positive --> (dates, friendships,adventures)
				2. negative --> (fights, insult matches,)
			ii. Mundane --> common meaningless chatter that have very little effect on characters states after any meaningful relationship has 
				developed (smalltalk, greetings, farewell,petty rude behavior)
			iii. History --> discussions about past events that the two speaking characters have done together or that one of the characters
				have done by themselves (climbed a mountain)
			iv. Gossip --> discussion about events that others have done
				1. history dialogue is more powerful than gossip dialogue

Characters how conversations start (when the player walks up and presses X)
	1. Have a list of potential conversation topics available depending on what is going on
		a. topics will be chained together
			i. chained conversation topics are 1 or more links
			ii. Ex list: smalltalk:weather->relationship(a,b):Gossip -> futureGoals:healthAndFitness,
		
Histories: Short Term, Long Term and static history
	1. setup histories as a chain of dialogue modules that the player and NPC or NPC and NPC had
	2. histories need the following elements:
		a. Game Time Reference: When did this event happen? ex the morning of the first week, 3rd day of spring.
		b. Game Location Reference: Where did this happen? ex. In the blonde mouse coffee house
		c. characters who are talking
		d. Dialogue Chain: includes modules and sub modules that are connect in the dialogue chain
			i. include reference characters for each sub module ex. who is being talked about
		e. The outcome: record the conversation outcome.  
			i. Include any changes made to any characters after the conversation
			ii. dirive if the conversation was positive, negative, or neutral
			iii. dirive if it was memerable (big stat change, attribute change like in relationship with)
				1. devise a stat increase threshold that signals when something is memerable
				2. attribute changes (friends with, in relationship with,...) are always memerable
		f. this will require some form of internal syntax
		ex. <gameTimeStamp>:<Location Stamp>:<personA,personB>,"smallTalk.weather(personA,personB):
			relationshiop.gossip(personA,personB):futureGoals.fitnessHealth(personA,personB)",
			<personA.friend+10,personB.freind+10,positive,not_memorable>
	3. Long term history records short term history that is considered memerable
		a. devise a time table for when short term history is moved to long term (x days after the time stamp)
	4. Static history is linked to static storyline dialogue
		a. recored differently
		b. required characters involved
		c. saved as a boolean (did it happen or not)
		d. always memerable
	5. histories belong to the characters and will be saves in data structures
		a. short-term stored in queue
		b. long-term saved in dictionary key == game character

Random History Generation between NPCs
	
Hub to Module think-tank
	hub determines if module is smallTalk
		can model game characters with unique values used for dialogue?
		best method is to Gain a referece to the gameCharacters
	SmallTalk determines if its weather, greetings, event or other sub-category
		need to have a reference to what each game character has as stats and attributes
